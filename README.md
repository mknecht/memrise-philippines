A repository of (most of) the data for my [Philippines course](http://www.memrise.com/course/442955/philippines-2/) on [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com).



# Sources and licenses:

Usually, the data here is taken from Wikipedia, and simply collected here for archiving purposes and easier access, when someone wants to clone something.

For each file there is license information available. For a given file  *filename.end*, see the file *filename.md*. If that one does not exist, it's in the *README.md* in the same directory.

## Modifications / Derivatives

All work derived I publish under the same license, i.e. the license of its original work.
